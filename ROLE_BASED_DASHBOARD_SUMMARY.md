## Technical Implementation

### 🔄 Dynamic Role-Based Routing
- Main dashboard (`/dashboard`) automatically routes users to role-specific dashboards
- User role determined from authentication context
- Prevents unauthorized access to other role dashboards

### 🛡️ Role-Based Navigation
- **RoleBasedNavigation** component shows different menu items per role
- Navigation items dynamically generated based on `user.role`
- Each role has distinct navigation paths and capabilities

### 📊 Dynamic Data Fetching
- **Role-specific API services** in `roleBasedAPI.ts`
- Separate API endpoints for each role: `studentAPI`, `facultyAPI`, `organizationAPI`, `adminAPI`
- Dynamic data loading based on user permissions
- Mock data with realistic structure for development

### 🎨 Role-Specific UI Elements
- **Different color schemes** for each role (blue for students, purple for faculty, green for organizations, red for admin)
- **Contextual features** - networking only for students, timetable editing only for faculty
- **Permission-based buttons** - actions available only to authorized roles
