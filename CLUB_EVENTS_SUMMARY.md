## 🚀 How to Deploy

### Step 1: Add Import to main.py

Add this at the top of `backend/main.py` (already added in the code):

```python
# Import club events API
from club_events_api import (
    create_club_event, get_club_events, get_all_club_events, approve_club_event,
    create_club_timeline, get_club_timeline, register_for_event,
    get_student_council_dashboard, mark_student_council
)
```

### Step 2: Add Endpoints to main.py

Copy all endpoints from `club_events_endpoints.py` and paste them at the end of `backend/main.py`.

### Step 3: Run Setup Script

```bash
cd backend
python setup_club_events.py
```

This will:
- Create all necessary database tables
- Mark Student Council club (if exists)
- Create sample events for testing

### Step 4: Restart Server

```bash
# If using uvicorn directly
uvicorn main:app --reload

# Or if using start script
python main.py
```

### Step 5: Verify Installation

Visit: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

You should see the new endpoints in the API documentation.

## 🎨 Frontend Integration Tips

### Calendar View
```typescript
// Fetch all events for calendar
const events = await fetch('/clubs/events/all?status=approved')
  .then(r => r.json());

// Display in calendar component
<FullCalendar
  events={events.map(e => ({
    title: e.title,
    start: `${e.event_date}T${e.start_time}`,
    end: `${e.event_date}T${e.end_time}`,
    extendedProps: { club: e.club_name, venue: e.venue }
  }))}
/>
```

### Event Card Component
```typescript
interface EventCardProps {
  event: ClubEvent;
  onRegister: (eventId: number) => void;
}

const EventCard = ({ event, onRegister }: EventCardProps) => (
  <div className="event-card">
    <h3>{event.title}</h3>
    <p>{event.club_name}</p>
    <p>{event.event_date} | {event.venue}</p>
    <p>{event.registration_count}/{event.max_participants} registered</p>
    <button onClick={() => onRegister(event.id)}>Register</button>
  </div>
);
```

### Student Council Dashboard
```typescript
const StudentCouncilDashboard = () => {
  const [dashboard, setDashboard] = useState(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/student-council/dashboard')
      .then(r => r.json())
      .then(setDashboard);
  }, []);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <Stats data={dashboard?.stats} />
      <PendingApprovals events={dashboard?.pending_approvals} />
      <ClubActivity clubs={dashboard?.club_activity} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Tables not created
**Solution:** Run `python setup_club_events.py` from backend directory

### Issue: Import error for club_events_api
**Solution:** Ensure `club_events_api.py` is in the backend directory

### Issue: 401 Unauthorized on endpoints
**Solution:** Check authentication token and user permissions

### Issue: Events not showing
**Solution:** Verify event status is "approved" and event_date is in future

### Issue: Cannot approve events
**Solution:** Ensure user is Student Council member or admin
